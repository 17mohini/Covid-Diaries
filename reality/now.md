Coming out of the Outbreak of 2020, the world has realized the value of clear skies and clean canals and quiet streets, of just _being_. Countries rallied together to fight the common enemy. Just like the Euro-American bonds stemming from the WW2 allied forces, the world has retained the memory of coming, working and staying together. Geo-political conflicts are reducing, there is finally real hope for tackling climate change, and humanity is knocking on the doors of a new age of peace and prosperity.

# USA
Every year, for two months, the whole nation shuts down. Every American is given $1000 per month for these two months. Those who can, work from home. However, vacations - staycations - are strongly encouraged. The rest take the time for themselves.

## 2026
### Socio-political Landscape
- In 2020, Democrats won the elections. They retained the House and reclaimed Senate majority. Till 2024, Biden was the President and Warren was the VP. Warren is now President. The election cycle for 2028 is starting.
- Trump still tweets. Don Jr and Ivanka are major forces. Fox News is going strong. That nexus and their base is slowly but surely shrinking in numbers and growing in rhetoric and intensity.
- The Republican party is finding its way back to Conservatism. Center-right politicians are gaining supprt and have timely, urgent cases to make about the ever-growing size of the government.

### Technology Landscape
- Most companies have grown the 'working remotely' muscle.
- Zoom and Netflix stocks have skyrocketed. Both have routinely cleared the trillion-dollar mark.


# India
### Geo-political Landscape
- India and Pakistan are (re)learning to cooperate. SAARC is a major force on the global stage.
- India also shuts down for two months every year. Janta Curfews happen in the summer for two . 

# Saudi Arabia/Middle East
- Reacting to the reduced demand for oil, the countries have aggressively invested in renewable energy. 
- Supermassive solar farms are a thing now, and these nations are working hard to still be the energy providers of the world.
