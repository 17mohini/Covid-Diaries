# Covid Diaries

### Vision
A global, collaboratively developed account of the current times, written from near-future

### Details
- We start a few years from now.
- We define the current state of the world in [reality](/reality/now.md).
- We define the characters in [characters](/people/characters.md).
- We write the diary entries in [diaries](/diaries).

### Getting Started
1. Read [now.md](/reality/now.md)
2. Read some diary entries and see who's writing them in [characters.md](/people/characters.md).
2. Define a character in this [characters.md](/people/characters.md) file.
3. Create a folder in [diaries](/diaries). Give it the name of your character. Create a file and start writing entries!
4. _Reality_ is special. Create PRs for submitting changes and contributing to [reality](/reality).

### Logistics
- Create issues to request changes from original authors, and assign those to them.
- Create issues for yourselves as well if you need to.
- Pages will be built off `master`.
- Create branches for _any_ changes and do PRs for `master`.
- Branches must have meaningful names. 
- Commit messages must be meaningful.
- Braches are to be short-lived, to be deleted after the changes are merged in `master`.
